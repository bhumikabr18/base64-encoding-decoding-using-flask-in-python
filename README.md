Project: Base64 Encoder and Decoder API Using Flask

Introduction
<br>

This project is a Flask-based API that allows users to encode or decode data in Base64 format. It accepts input either as a string or a number, processes the input to either encode it to Base64 or decode it from Base64, and then returns the corresponding result.
<br>
Base64 encoding is commonly used to encode binary data, especially when transmitting over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This project provides a simple API to handle Base64 encoding and decoding operations through HTTP requests.


Features
<br>
1. Encode Input: Converts user-provided input (number or string) into Base64 format.
2. Decode Input: Decodes Base64-encoded strings back into their original format.
3. Flask Framework: The API is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.
4. User-Friendly API: The API takes JSON input and returns JSON output for easy integration with various applications.
